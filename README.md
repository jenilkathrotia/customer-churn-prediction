## Overview
This project is a **machine learning application** that predicts whether a customer is likely to stop using a companyâ€™s product or service (**churn**).  

Churn is a critical problem in industries like **telecom, banking, SaaS, retail, e-commerce, and streaming services**.  
By predicting churn in advance, businesses can take preventive actions (e.g., discounts, personalized offers, improved support) to **retain customers and reduce revenue loss**.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
  - Handles missing values, scales numerical features, and encodes categoricals  
  - Supports class imbalance techniques (SMOTE, class weights)

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Nets (optional)  
  - Model selection based on **Precision-Recall AUC** and **ROC-AUC**

- **Explainability (XAI)**  
  - SHAP/LIME to explain predictions  
  - Identify top reasons for customer churn

- **Deployment**  
  - **Streamlit App** â†’ interactive dashboard for predictions + explanations  
  - **FastAPI Service** â†’ REST API endpoint for integration into CRM systems  
  - **Dockerized** â†’ portable and deployable on AWS/GCP/Azure

## Dataset
- Example dataset: [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
- Target variable: `Churn` (`Yes` = 1, `No` = 0)  
- Features include demographics, services subscribed, billing/payment info, and usage behavior  

**Note:** Dataset is not included in the repo due to licensing. Please download from Kaggle and place in `data/`.
